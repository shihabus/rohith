        This design project was one of the major parts of the whole redesign
        process that we’ve done in Betterhalf.ai. Betterhalf is a matchmaking
        platform built for urban Indians. To elevate the experience of the app,
        we recently redesigned the whole app. This case study narrates the story
        about how we’ve improved our user engagement by redesigning the profile
        viewing experience of our mobile app.

          We’ve found that our user engagement rate was low even if we had a
          high customer acquisition. And through the help of the research and
          usability studies, we've seen a slight behavior change in our users
          while using the app.

          The solution is to improve the experience by introducing additional

          user flow to change the behavior of the users towards the app.

      <p class="content-para" style="padding-bottom: 60px;">
        We conducted telephone interviews with 12 of our users from different
        backgrounds. Most of them said that they were confused while taking a
        decision and they were not sure about connecting with all the potential
        matches. This actually reduced the chances for them to find their ideal
        life partner.

        We conducted a semi-structured usability test to understand the behavior
        patterns of our users. The study was more focused on the decision-making
        patterns of the users and the information that they look for in every
        profile and their response towards some of our major features.

      <p class="bold-sub-header">Online survey</p>
      <p class="content-para" style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
        The main motive of this survey was to find out the issues that the users
        are facing in general, to know their point of view on some of the
        features and their expectations from the product. This study helped us
        to get more data to drive design decisions like the priorities and the
        value of the features. It also helped us in finding the numbers.
